Ripples is a software framework to study the Influence Maximization problem.
The problem of Influence Maximization was introduced in 2001 by Domingos and
Richardson [DR01]_ and later formulated as an optimization problem under the
framework of submodular functions by Kempe et al. [KTR03]_.

Given a graph :math:`G`, a network diffusion model :math:`M`, and positive
integer :math:`k`, the influence maximization problem is the problem of
selecting a set of seeds :math:`S` of cardinality :math:`k` such that
:math:`\mathop{\mathbb{E}}[I(S)]` is maximized, where :math:`I(S)` is the
influence function.

Our goal with Ripples is to provide tools implementing fast and scalable
state-of-the-art approximation algorithms to solve the influence maximization
problem.

Quickstart with Conan
=====================

First of all we need to set up the Python environment needed.

.. code-block:: shell

   $ pip install --user pipenv
   $ pipenv --three
   $ pipenv install
   $ pipenv shell

Then we need to install dependencies:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ conan create conan/waf-generator user/stable
   $ conan create conan/trng user/stable
   $ conan install .

Now we are ready to configure and build ripples:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ ./waf configure --enable-mpi build_release
   # or without MPI support
   $ ./waf configure build_release

In the case you are a Mac OS user, you will need to install the LLVM toolchain
through brew that comes with OpenMP support.  Compiling Ripples than is as
simple as:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ ./waf configure --openmp-root=/usr/local/opt/llvm --enable-mpi build_release
   # or without MPI support
   $ ./waf configure --openmp-root=/usr/local/opt/llvm build_release


Build Instructions
==================

This project uses `WAF <https://waf.io>`_ as its build system.  Building Ripples
is a two-step process: configure the project and build the tools.  Before
attempting to build, be sure to have the following dependencies installed:

- A compiler with C++14 support and OpenMP support.
- `Spdlog <https://github.com/gabime/spdlog>`_
- `JSON <https://github.com/nlohmann/json>`_
- `TRNG4 <https://github.com/rabauke/trng4>`_
- An MPI library (optional)

The configure step can be invoked with:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ ./waf configure

or optionally to enable the MPI implementations:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ ./waf configure --enable-mpi

The build system offers options that can be used to help the configuration step
locate dependencies (e.g., they are installed in unconventional paths).  A
complete list of the options can be obtained with:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ ./waf configure --help


After the configuration step succeeds, the build step can be executed by
running:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ ./waf build_release

For more detailed instruction, please read :ref:`build:Step By Step Build
Instructions`.

The tools compiled can be found under ``build/release/tools/``.  A complete set of
command line options can be obtained through:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ ./build/release/tools/<tool_name> --help
